This project uses [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with the [Kanji Grid](https://github.com/tsudoko/kanjigrid) Plugin (kudos to [tsudoko](https://github.com/tsudoko)) to roughly track my progress in learning [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji).  
"Why?" you may ask. Because statistics are fun, especially colourful ones! 😁
